# PyTorch_Pedestrian_Finetuning_Tutorial
Based on Torchvision Object Detection Finetuning Tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html

The model has been simplified from a detector/segmentation model to just a detector model

Files with prefix "my_" were modified by me from the tutorial

Penn-Fudan Pedestrian Dataset used:
https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/

extract dataset to "PennFudanPed" folder in working directory

KNOWN ISSUE:
model gets stuck with Assertion Error during evaluate step
